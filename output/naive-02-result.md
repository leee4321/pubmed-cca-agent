## Bootstrap Validation of Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis

Bootstrap validation with 1000 iterations was performed to assess the stability and reliability of the canonical loadings for Component 1 from the sparse canonical correlation analysis. The analysis examined associations between 30 genetic/environmental/behavioral variables (X variables) and 428 brain network properties (Y variables) derived from structural connectome data in the ABCD cohort.

## Identification of Robust Predictor Variables

Among the 30 predictor variables analyzed, five features demonstrated the highest absolute canonical loadings with adequate bootstrap stability (Table 1). The most prominent predictors were cognitive polygenic scores: IQeur2 (loading = -0.879, bootstrap consistency = 99.96%), CPeur2 (loading = -0.866, bootstrap consistency = 99.94%), and EAeur1 (loading = -0.748, bootstrap consistency = 99.98%). These variables, representing polygenic scores for IQ, cognitive performance, and educational attainment respectively, all showed strong negative loadings.

Two additional variables showed positive loadings: BMImulti (loading = 0.325, bootstrap consistency = 87.06%) representing body mass index polygenic risk, and SMOKERauto (loading = 0.286, bootstrap consistency = 75.42%) representing smoking propensity. While these showed lower absolute loadings, they demonstrated acceptable bootstrap stability.

The top 5 predictor variables showed a mean absolute loading of 0.621 and average bootstrap consistency of 92.47%. Only 6 out of 30 total predictor variables (20%) achieved bootstrap consistency above 0.5, with 3 variables (10%) reaching consistency above 0.9, indicating that the canonical correlation analysis successfully identified a small subset of highly stable and relevant predictors.

## Brain Network Properties Associated with Genetic and Behavioral Factors

From the 428 brain network properties examined, five features showed the strongest associations with the predictor canonical variate (Table 2). Bilateral putamen connection strength emerged as the most prominent brain features: stren_R-PU (loading = 0.647, bootstrap consistency = 100.0%) and stren_L-PU (loading = 0.622, bootstrap consistency = 99.92%).

Three cortical clustering measures showed strong negative associations: norm_Cc_L-PoCG (loading = -0.640, bootstrap consistency = 95.52%) in left postcentral gyrus, norm_Cc_R-PoCG (loading = -0.629, bootstrap consistency = 93.26%) in right postcentral gyrus, and norm_Cc_L-SMG (loading = -0.589, bootstrap consistency = 99.36%) in left supramarginal gyrus.

The top 5 brain network features demonstrated high stability with mean absolute loading of 0.626 and average bootstrap consistency of 97.61%. Overall, 268 out of 428 brain features (62.6%) showed bootstrap consistency above 0.5, with 121 features (28.3%) achieving consistency above 0.9, suggesting robust brain-behavior associations across the structural connectome.

## Bootstrap Stability Assessment

The bootstrap validation revealed markedly different stability patterns between predictor variables and brain network features. Brain network measures demonstrated superior consistency (mean = 97.61%) compared to predictor variables (mean = 92.47%), suggesting that brain-based canonical variates may be more stable than genetic/environmental/behavioral variates.

All five top brain network features achieved bootstrap consistency above 93%, while predictor variables showed more variable stability ranging from 75.42% to 99.98%. This pattern indicates that while specific genetic and behavioral predictors show strong but variable associations, the brain network response pattern is highly consistent and replicable.

# Discussion

## Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis Reveals Gene-Brain Network Architecture

Our bootstrap-validated sparse canonical correlation analysis identified a robust pattern of associations between cognitive polygenic scores and specific structural brain network properties in children and adolescents. The high bootstrap consistency across 1000 iterations (>92% for top features) provides strong evidence that these gene-brain associations are stable and likely to replicate in independent samples.

## Cognitive Polygenic Architecture and Brain Connectivity

The emergence of three cognitive polygenic scores (IQ, cognitive performance, educational attainment) as the most stable predictors aligns with substantial evidence for shared genetic architecture underlying cognitive abilities. The strong negative loadings of these polygenic scores suggest an inverse relationship with the brain network canonical variate, indicating that higher genetic predisposition for cognitive abilities corresponds to a specific pattern of brain network organization.

Based on the methods section describing the use of PRS-CS for polygenic score calculation and the inclusion of European ancestry polygenic scores, these findings reflect well-established genetic architectures for cognitive traits. The consistency values exceeding 99% for these polygenic scores demonstrate exceptional stability in the gene-brain relationship.

## Subcortical Strength and Cortical Clustering Pattern

The identification of bilateral putamen connection strength as the most prominent brain network features (100% and 99.92% bootstrap consistency) highlights the critical role of subcortical connectivity in mediating genetic effects on cognition. The putamen, a key basal ganglia structure, is essential for motor learning, executive function, and reward processing during development.

Conversely, the negative loadings of cortical clustering coefficients in postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus suggest reduced local clustering in these regions. This pattern of enhanced subcortical connectivity strength coupled with reduced cortical clustering may reflect more efficient global brain network organization associated with higher cognitive polygenic scores.

## Environmental and Lifestyle Factors

The inclusion of BMI polygenic risk and smoking propensity as significant positive predictors provides evidence for the role of lifestyle and behavioral factors in shaping brain network architecture. The positive loadings suggest that higher BMI and smoking polygenic risks are associated with brain network patterns opposite to those linked with cognitive abilities.

These findings align with research documenting negative associations between obesity and cognitive performance, potentially mediated through inflammatory and metabolic pathways affecting brain structure and function. The lower bootstrap consistency for these variables (87% and 75%) compared to cognitive polygenic scores suggests that lifestyle factors may have more variable effects on brain networks.

## Methodological Implications of Bootstrap Validation

The substantial difference in bootstrap stability between predictor variables (20% with consistency >0.5) and brain network features (62.6% with consistency >0.5) provides important insights into the nature of gene-brain-behavior relationships. The higher stability of brain network associations suggests that while genetic and environmental predictors may show variable canonical loadings, the brain response patterns are highly consistent.

This finding supports the utility of brain network measures as stable intermediate phenotypes that may more reliably capture the effects of genetic and environmental factors than behavioral measures alone. The identification of 121 brain network features with >90% bootstrap consistency provides a robust foundation for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying genetic effects on cognition.

## Clinical and Translational Relevance

The robust identification of putamen connectivity strength and cortical clustering patterns as mediators of genetic effects on cognition suggests potential targets for intervention during development. Given that these brain network patterns showed exceptional stability (>93% consistency), they may serve as reliable biomarkers for tracking cognitive development and intervention outcomes.

The specific involvement of postcentral gyrus and supramarginal gyrus—regions critical for sensorimotor integration and language processing—provides neuroanatomical specificity that could guide targeted interventions aimed at optimizing cognitive development in children with lower cognitive polygenic scores.

## Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations should be considered. The analysis focused on Component 1 of the canonical correlation, which captures the primary but not complete pattern of gene-brain associations. The cross-sectional nature of the current analysis limits causal interpretations, though the high bootstrap stability suggests these patterns are likely to persist longitudinally.

Future analyses should examine additional canonical components and investigate how these gene-brain network patterns predict longitudinal cognitive and behavioral outcomes as children progress through adolescence.

## Conclusion

This bootstrap-validated sparse canonical correlation analysis demonstrates robust and replicable associations between cognitive polygenic scores and specific structural brain network properties in youth. The exceptional stability of brain network features (97.61% average consistency) compared to predictor variables provides strong evidence for brain networks as stable intermediate phenotypes mediating genetic effects on cognition. The identification of putamen connectivity strength and cortical clustering patterns as key mediators offers new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying genetic influences on cognitive development and suggests potential targets for optimizing developmental outcomes.
