Introduction
Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for brain development (Bethlehem et al., 2022). Proper brain development during this time is vital for cognitive and behavioral maturation (Bunge & Wright, 2007; Luna et al., 2010) and mental health (Fornito et al., 2015; Paus et al., 2008). This development is shaped by a complex interplay between genetic predispositions, environmental influences, and brain network dynamics, yet the precise mechanisms underlying these relationships remain poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the connections between the brain, cognitive-behavioral traits in children, and the impact of genetics and the environment on brain development is crucial in developmental and clinical neuroscience. 
The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study provides an unprecedented opportunity to examine these interrelations in a large, representative sample (Jernigan et al., 2018). Leveraging multimodal neuroimaging, genome-wide polygenic scores (PGSs), and extensive environmental and behavioral assessments, the ABCD dataset enables a more comprehensive modeling of developmental trajectories than previously possible.
The brain is best understood as a complex, interconnected network, rather than a collection of isolated regions. Graph-theoretic approaches to brain connectivity provide powerful tools to quantify structural network properties such as integration (e.g., global efficiency), segregation (e.g., modularity), and centrality (e.g., degree centrality) (Rubinov & Sporns, 2010). Diffusion MRI and tractography allow for the reconstruction of white matter networks, enabling researchers to examine how these structural connections support cognition (Jeurissen et al., 2019; Sotiropoulos & Zalesky, 2019). Notably, individual differences in brain network organization have been linked to cognitive abilities (Bathelt et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2016; Koenis et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2017; Suprano et al., 2020), psychiatric risk (Alexander-Bloch et al., 2010; Collin et al., 2017; Rudie et al., 2012), and environmental influences such as socioeconomic status (Kim et al., 2019; Tooley et al., 2020). However, how genetic and environmental factors jointly shape structural brain networks, and whether these networks mediate their influence on cognitive and psychiatric outcomes, remains poorly understood.
Twin and heritability studies suggest that brain network properties are, at least in part, genetically influenced, with estimates of heritability for measures like global efficiency ranging from 25% to 70% (Koenis et al., 2015; van den Heuvel et al., 2013). Yet, the specific genetic variants shaping these structural networks—particularly in the context of cognitive and psychiatric outcomes—remain poorly characterized. Investigating this gene-brain-behavior interplay is essential for understanding how biological predispositions manifest in cognitive and mental health outcomes during development.
Despite valuable insights from previous studies, most prior research has employed univariate approaches, limiting the ability to capture the multivariate complexity of the gene/environment-brain-behavior relationship. To address this limitation, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been widely applied to investigate holistic relationships between brain connectivity, cognitive function, genetics, and environmental factors (Hotelling, 1936; Wang et al., 2020). However, conventional CCA often struggle with high-dimensional datasets. In such settings, conventional approaches can lead to overfitting and unstable canonical weights, which limit the generalizability of the findings. To address these limitations, we applied sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) (Witten et al., 2009). By incorporating L1 regularization, SCCA identifies a subset of essential contributing variables, thereby enhancing interpretability and ensuring more stable and robust associations that are likely to generalize across independent samples. 
Utilizing the ABCD dataset’s expansive genetic, environmental, neuroimaging, and behavioral data, we employed a pairwise SCCA framework to independently characterize the unique axes of covariation between (1) genetic factors and brain networks, (2) environmental factors and brain networks, and (3) brain networks and behavioral phenotypes. This approach allowed us to capture how specific brain network properties, such as integration and segregation, associate with diverse etiological and phenotypic factors. We then investigated whether the brain network patterns most relevant to child behavior also mediate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on those outcomes.
By integrating genetics, environmental, neuroimaging, and behavioral assessments in a large, developmentally significant cohort, this study seeks to elucidate the complex gene-environmental-brain-behavior pathways that shape cognitive and mental health outcomes. This research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the biological and environmental foundations of brain development and lays the groundwork for future interventions aimed at optimizing cognitive and psychological well-being in youth.
