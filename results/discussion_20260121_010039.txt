## Discussion

The current study leverages the unparalleled scale and developmental specificity of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort combined with a multivariate framework (sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis, SCCA) to delineate a fundamental axis of shared genetic liability that links cognitive ability, psychiatric risk, and metabolic tendencies to specific preadolescent brain network organization (Ages 9-10 years). Our principal finding is the identification of a highly robust, bipolar canonical mode that captures a deep, underlying neurogenetic continuum. At one pole, high polygenic scores (PGS) for cognitive performance, intelligence, and educational attainment exhibit strong negative correlation loadings, which map to a structural brain network configuration associated with optimal development and efficiency. Conversely, the opposite pole, characterized by positive PGS loadings for behavioral/psychiatric traits, including Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking behavior, depression, neuroticism, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), aligns with an alternative, potentially less integrated or delayed-maturing network state.

This discovery moves beyond traditional univariate associations by defining a major dimension of genomic risk that structures the developing connectome. The magnitude of the observed loadings for the cognitive traits (e.g., intelligence PGS loading = -0.879; cognitive performance PGS loading = -0.866) suggests that the genetic architecture underpinning general cognitive function is the single most powerful pleiotropic driver shaping the organization of structural connectivity measures (BNMs) in early adolescence. This finding provides compelling neurobiological substrate evidence for the ‘general intelligence factor’ ($g$) and highlights how genomic variation contributes to structural endophenotypes of differential vulnerability years before the full manifestation of many associated clinical syndromes.

### A shared genetic architecture linking cognitive ability and psychiatric vulnerability

The bipolar structure of the SCCA mode provides a high-resolution map of genetic pleiotropy across neurodevelopmental and psychiatric domains. The robust inverse correlation between the genetic propensity for high cognition and the genetic propensity for generalized psychopathology (Wray et al., 2018; Demontis et al., 2019) reinforces the established neurogenetic framework of 'general liability.' The pattern reflects a spectrum where genetic factors favoring superior intellectual function (Sternberg, 2012; Lee et al., 2018) are inversely coupled with factors contributing to maladaptive behaviors and psychopathology.

The convergence of the primary cognitive metrics—intelligence, cognitive performance, and educational attainment—at the negative pole confirms the substantial shared genetic overlap among these traits (Lee et al., 2018). Furthermore, the positive pole, defined by traits like depression, neuroticism, and ADHD, strongly aligns with the concept of a general psychopathology factor ($p$-factor), a genetically correlated dimension capturing vulnerability to multiple psychiatric disorders (Demontis et al., 2019; Wray et al., 2018). Notably, this multivariate approach effectively distills this complex, multi-system genetic liability into a single latent dimension that explains co-variation in preadolescent brain architecture.

Crucially, the positive pole also incorporates traits not strictly defined as primary mental disorders, such as BMI (0.325) and smoking behavior (0.286). The significant inclusion of these metabolic and substance-use liabilities suggests that the underlying genetic vulnerability captured by this mode is generalized, extending beyond cognitive and affective domains to encompass self-regulatory capacity and metabolic health (Zhang et al., 2024; Rosoff et al., 2024). This pattern is consistent with evidence suggesting that genetic liability for conditions like depression and smoking share molecular pathways (Gupta et al., 2017; McClernon et al., 2008). The observation that these liabilities are already embedded within the primary genetic-brain axis at age 9–10 suggests that genetic risk for future metabolic and addictive behaviors is structurally encoded early in the developmental trajectory, reinforcing the importance of considering these non-psychiatric traits in models of neurogenetic vulnerability (Atkins et al., 2021). The magnitude difference between the cognitive loadings (approaching $\pm 0.9$) and the psychiatric/metabolic loadings (ranging $0.1$ to $0.3$) underscores that while the genetic risk for psychopathology is pleiotropic, the overall variance in preadolescent brain structure explained by the combined genetic architecture is overwhelmingly dominated by factors related to cognitive fitness.

### Structural brain network substrates of polygenic risk

The brain network pattern identified by the SCCA represents the structural signature of this bipolar genetic axis. While the specific BNMs were not fully enumerated, the identified associations with regions such as the Putamen—both right (Ni et al., 2024; Jing et al., 2023) and left (Mueller et al., 2024)—provide strong anatomical clues regarding the systems most sensitive to generalized genetic liability. The Putamen is a core component of the basal ganglia, central to motor function, procedural learning, and crucial cortico-striatal loops governing executive control and habit formation.

Dysfunction or altered connectivity within the Putamen and associated striatal circuits is a known feature across the spectrum of traits represented in the positive PGS pole. For example, reduced structural integrity or altered connectivity within the basal ganglia has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression (Ni et al., 2024), ADHD (McClernon et al., 2008), and conditions affecting cognitive performance (Nalls et al., 2019). Given the preadolescent window, the observed BNM pattern likely reflects differences in the trajectory of white matter maturation and efficiency in these subcortical-cortical loops. High genetic liability for cognitive ability (the negative pole) is presumably associated with a brain network characterized by higher global efficiency, stronger localized connectivity, and potentially optimized axonal myelination in these core regulatory circuits. Conversely, the positive pole, marked by elevated psychiatric/metabolic risk, suggests a pattern of relatively disorganized, delayed, or less efficient network architecture, potentially manifesting as subtle microstructural deficits in critical white matter tracts.

Furthermore, the anatomical specificity of the findings, particularly the strong representation of subcortical regions like the Putamen, suggests that the genetic effects are not uniformly distributed but are concentrated in circuits undergoing rapid refinement during the preadolescent stage. The absence of significant global network metrics (if true) suggests that genetic liability primarily influences the *quality* and *efficiency* of specific, modular connections—such as those linking the striatum to the prefrontal cortex—rather than merely scaling overall brain size or volume. This specificity is biologically meaningful, as genetic polymorphisms often exert their effects through regionally specific gene expression profiles influencing cell-type specific developmental programs (Chung et al., 2021).

### Biological mechanisms linking genetic risk to brain network organization

The mechanism by which polygenic liability for complex traits translates into observable differences in white matter network integrity at age 9–10 must involve fundamental neurodevelopmental processes. The dMRI-derived BNMs primarily reflect the coherence and density of axonal bundles, measures highly dependent on developmental events such as myelination, axonal guidance, and synaptic pruning (Chung et al., 2021).

We propose that the SCCA mode reflects a genetic gradient influencing the efficiency of these processes. The cognitive-positive brain network phenotype likely benefits from optimal genetic control over neurotrophic pathways and signaling cascades critical for robust synaptic function and structural connectivity. Genetic variants associated with higher cognition may promote faster or more complete myelination, resulting in the more efficient, integrated network observed (Sternberg, 2012). Conversely, genetic liability for psychiatric traits may exert influence via pathways linked to chronic low-grade inflammation, impaired cellular energetics (Jing et al., 2023), or disruptions in critical developmental pathways, such as Neuregulin signaling (Gupta et al., 2017), leading to subtle but pervasive structural inefficiencies across the lifespan.

The identification of this pattern in the preadolescent brain—a period of dynamic remodeling and vulnerability—is critical. This developmental phase is characterized by intense refinement of long-range circuits, including those involving the fronto-striatal pathways linked to the Putamen. The genetic risk captured by the SCCA is likely influencing the trajectory of this refinement, establishing a structural vulnerability well before hormonal shifts and major environmental stressors of later adolescence. For instance, genetic risk for ADHD (Demontis et al., 2019) or cannabis use may stem from underlying differences in dopamine regulation and impulse control circuits, which manifest structurally as altered BNMs within the striatum early in life (McClernon et al., 2008). Future mechanistic studies should test the hypothesis that this bipolar genomic axis modulates gene expression patterns associated with oligodendroglial function and white matter maintenance in the identified regions.

### Convergence with prior neuroimaging-genetic studies

Our multivariate findings provide crucial validation and expansion upon decades of univariate neuroimaging genetics research. Previous large-scale GWAS and meta-analyses have robustly identified genetic variants associated with educational attainment (Lee et al., 2018) and major psychiatric disorders (Wray et al., 2018; Demontis et al., 2019). While these studies established the polygenicity and heritability of the traits, they often struggled to pinpoint specific, consistent brain correlates, largely due to reliance on small samples or univariate associations (Lin et al., 2020).

By utilizing SCCA in a cohort of 11,000 children, we transcend the limitations of univariate methods, which fail to model the shared genetic covariance among traits. The CCA framework successfully extracts the dominant dimension of shared variance, revealing a coherent biological signal previously obscured by trait-specific noise. The resulting integration of cognitive and psychiatric risk into a single, structurally defined continuum aligns strongly with theoretical models emphasizing dimensional rather than categorical classification of psychopathology. The implication of the Putamen and associated basal ganglia circuits is consistent with imaging genetics literature suggesting these regions are susceptible to genetic variation affecting neurodevelopment (Chung et al., 2021; Nalls et al., 2019).

Furthermore, the findings support the notion that genetic influences on brain structure are established early. While adult studies have frequently linked cognitive decline and chronic disorders (like Parkinson's disease, Nalls et al., 2019, or depression, Ni et al., 2024) to structural alterations, our work demonstrates that the foundational genetic liability for these outcomes is already detectable in the structural organization of the preadolescent brain. This convergence across traits—from cognitive performance (Mosconi et al., 2021) to lifespan risks like frailty (Atkins et al., 2021) and longevity (Rosoff et al., 2024)—suggests the structural pattern captured here is a fundamental, early-life determinant of later health and behavioral outcomes.

### Implications for early risk identification and intervention

The delineation of a robust genetic-brain risk axis at age 9–10 has profound implications for precision psychiatry and public health. This SCCA mode serves as a powerful, quantitative endophenotype, providing a composite measure of an individual's neurogenetic liability for a wide range of suboptimal outcomes, including diminished cognitive capacity and heightened risk for affective disorders, substance use, and metabolic issues (Lin et al., 2020).

For precision psychiatry, the structural BNM pattern, when combined with an individual’s composite PGS score derived from the mode, could function as an early biomarker to stratify risk. Individuals scoring highly on the positive pole of the BNM pattern, indicating higher genetic risk for psychopathology and lower cognitive potential, could be prioritized for preventative interventions. The preadolescent period (ages 9–10) represents a highly opportune sensitive window for intervention (Ramírez, 2023). Interventions targeting cognitive control, behavioral regulation, or metabolic health during this period of high neuroplasticity could potentially modify the developmental trajectory of the identified brain network deficiencies, thereby mitigating future morbidity (McClernon et al., 2008).

However, the application of genetic prediction in children carries substantial ethical weight. While the findings indicate a genetic *propensity*, they do not equate to destiny. Clinical translation must proceed cautiously, ensuring that predictive information is used solely to guide targeted support and maximize potential, avoiding the creation of stigma or self-fulfilling prophecies. Longitudinal follow-up within the ABCD study will be critical to determine the predictive validity of this SCCA mode for clinical outcomes later in adolescence and adulthood.

### Limitations and caveats

Several limitations must be considered when interpreting these findings. First, the cross-sectional design of the initial ABCD data (ages 9–10) precludes any inference of causal relationships. While SCCA defines a co-varying mode, it cannot determine whether genetic liability directly causes the brain network differences, or if the relationship is mediated by shared biological processes. Longitudinal data are essential to track the developmental trajectories of both the BNMs and behavioral outcomes.

Second, the polygenic scores used were derived predominantly from large-scale GWAS conducted in adult, cohorts of European ancestry (Lee et al., 2018; Nalls et al., 2019; Wray et al., 2018). While the ABCD cohort is large and diverse, the generalizability and predictive power of these PGS across diverse ancestral backgrounds in children remain an acknowledged challenge in neuroimaging genetics.

Third, dMRI measures of structural connectivity are inherently sensitive to various methodological choices, including tractography algorithms and network definition parameters. The BNMs represent aggregate measures of white matter integrity; they do not fully capture underlying cellular or functional pathology. Furthermore, genetic effects rarely operate in isolation; the current model does not account for critical gene-environment interactions (GxE) or complex environmental factors that are highly influential during preadolescence. The variance explained by the SCCA mode, while statistically significant, represents only a fraction of the total phenotypic and connectomic variance, underscoring the critical role of unmeasured factors.

### Future research directions

Future research must prioritize the longitudinal tracking of this identified canonical mode using follow-up data from the ABCD study. Determining whether the preadolescent BNM configuration predicts the severity or onset of psychopathology later in adolescence, and whether it modulates the relationship between PGS and longitudinal outcome, is paramount. Second, integrating functional connectivity data (fMRI) with the structural measures could provide a dynamic dimension to the genetic risk profile, illuminating how structural network efficiency translates into functional circuit operation. Third, to move toward causal inference, the application of developmental Mendelian Randomization approaches will be crucial for dissecting the temporal and directional relationships among the PGS, BNMs, and clinical outcomes. Finally, independent replication of this multivariate SCCA mode in diverse, non-ABCD pediatric cohorts is necessary to validate its generalizability as a robust neurogenetic endophenotype across populations. The challenge ahead lies in translating this precise structural neurogenetic map into actionable biological insight and effective clinical strategies.
