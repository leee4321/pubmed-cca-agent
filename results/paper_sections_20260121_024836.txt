### Identification of a Robust Canonical Mode Linking Polygenic Predisposition to Brain Network Architecture

Leveraging sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) on the large-scale Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort (N $\approx$ 11,000), we identified a single, highly robust canonical mode (Mode 1) that maximally associates multivariate Polygenic Scores (PGSs) with a broad array of structural Brain Network Measures (BNMs). This mode establishes a significant and distributed association between genetic predispositions for cognitive ability and psychiatric risk on one hand, and regional alterations in connectivity metrics (strength and degree) on the other.

The identified canonical mode involved a substantial proportion of the tested variables: 19 out of 30 PGS variables (63.3%) and 185 out of 428 BNM variables (43.2%) contributed significantly to the multivariate association, defined by their 95% confidence intervals (CI) excluding zero based on 5,000 bootstrap iterations. The resulting canonical variates defined a genetic axis anchored by high cognitive ability at one pole (negative loadings) and high psychiatric/metabolic risk at the opposing pole (positive loadings), corresponding to a neural axis characterized by specific alterations in regional network strength and degree (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 1).

### Polygenic Score Loadings Defining the Canonical Genetic Axis

The PGS loadings showed a strong bifurcation, grouping cognitive and educational attainment traits predominantly at the negative end of the axis, and psychiatric, metabolic, and externalizing behaviors at the positive end (Fig. 1b).

#### High-Magnitude Negative Loadings: Cognitive and Educational Predisposition

The negative pole of the canonical mode was dominated by polygenic scores associated with general cognitive capacity and educational achievement. Intelligence (IQeur2) exhibited the strongest loading estimate, at $-0.879$ (95% CI: [$-0.916$, $-0.793$]), demonstrating the primary contribution of this trait to the overall genetic pattern. Closely following in magnitude was cognitive performance (CPeur2), with a loading of $-0.866$ (95% CI: [$-0.908$, $-0.772$]), reinforcing the central role of crystallized and fluid intelligence polygenic risk in this canonical dimension. Educational attainment (EAeur1) also contributed substantially, showing a robust loading of $-0.748$ (95% CI: [$-0.800$, $-0.643$]). These three variables collectively define a highly coherent genetic protective factor axis.

In addition to cognitive metrics, several other behavioral traits also loaded significantly negatively, albeit with smaller magnitudes, suggesting an overlap between protective cognitive factors and lower risk for certain maladaptive behaviors. These included antisocial personality (ASPauto), with a loading of $-0.268$ (95% CI: [$-0.424$, $-0.139$]), cannabis use (CANNABISauto), loading at $-0.137$ (95% CI: [$-0.277$, $-0.073$]), and eating disorder (EDauto), which demonstrated the smallest but still significant negative loading of $-0.036$ (95% CI: [$-0.132$, $-0.004$]).

#### Positive Loadings: Psychiatric, Metabolic, and Externalizing Risk

The positive pole of the canonical mode was characterized by polygenic risk scores for a diverse array of psychiatric, metabolic, and behavioral traits, indicating a shared underlying genetic vulnerability architecture (Fig. 1b). The highest magnitude positive loadings were observed for variables related to somatic and externalizing risk. Body mass index (BMImulti) was the top contributor, loading at $0.325$ (95% CI: [$0.155$, $0.499$]), followed by smoking behavior (SMOKERauto) at $0.286$ (95% CI: [$0.122$, $0.421$]).

Internalizing and major psychiatric disorders formed a prominent cluster. Depression (DEPmulti) showed a loading of $0.181$ (95% CI: [$0.136$, $0.281$]), closely followed by neuroticism (NEUROTICISMauto) at $0.169$ (95% CI: [$0.115$, $0.249$]). Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHDeur6), a key externalizing phenotype, loaded positively at $0.148$ (95% CI: [$0.089$, $0.261$]). Other significant positive contributors included major depressive disorder (MDDeur6) at $0.106$ (95% CI: [$0.051$, $0.142$]), generalized worry (WORRYauto) at $0.105$ (95% CI: [$0.039$, $0.188$]), and schizophrenia (SCZ\_METAauto) at $0.102$ (95% CI: [$0.017$, $0.149$]). The clustering of these diverse psychiatric and metabolic phenotypes at the positive pole confirms a latent dimension of general polygenic risk antagonistic to the cognitive and educational axis.

### Brain Network Metric Loadings Defining the Canonical Neural Axis

The BNM loadings defined the corresponding structural signature associated with the identified genetic axis (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 2). Overall, the canonical mode was primarily driven by alterations in regional connectivity metrics (strength and degree), while global topological measures showed limited contribution.

#### Global Network Properties

We examined four key global metrics of structural network organization. None of the global measures met the threshold for statistical significance (95% CI excluding zero), indicating that the multivariate genetic association primarily impacts specific network nodes rather than whole-brain topological properties. Global density showed a loading of $-0.104$ (95% CI: [$-0.495$, $0.396$]); optimal modularity loaded at $0.092$ (95% CI: [$-0.231$, $0.310$]); and small-worldness loaded at $0.017$ (95% CI: [$-0.206$, $0.188$]). Global efficiency (E:glob) showed a modest positive loading of $0.208$, but its 95% CI ([$0.025$, $0.441$]) narrowly crossed the significance threshold at the lower bound, suggesting a trend towards greater global integration, but not meeting strict statistical criteria.

#### Regional Connectivity Loadings: Strength and Degree

The 185 significant BNMs defined a spatially specific signature, demonstrating a sharp contrast between regional strength metrics (positively loaded) and regional degree metrics (negatively loaded).

**High-Magnitude Positive Loadings: Regional Strength and Subcortical Salience**

The strongest positive loadings, which associate with the psychiatric/metabolic risk PGS axis, were concentrated almost exclusively in regional strength metrics within subcortical and limbic regions. The highest magnitude contributors were observed in the bilateral putamen, demonstrating robust and synchronized involvement. Right-Putamen regional strength showed the maximal BNM loading of $0.647$ (95% CI: [$0.437$, $0.677$]), closely followed by the Left-Putamen regional strength at $0.623$ (95% CI: [$0.420$, $0.665$]).

Limbic and paralimbic structures also demonstrated substantial positive contributions. Right-Hippocampus regional strength loaded at $0.559$ (95% CI: [$0.287$, $0.623$]). The bilateral insula, a key node in the salience network, also exhibited high positive loadings: Left-insula strength was $0.542$ (95% CI: [$0.349$, $0.582$]), and Right-insula strength was $0.528$ (95% CI: [$0.320$, $0.558$]). This pattern indicates that a polygenic predisposition toward psychiatric and metabolic vulnerability is structurally associated with globally stronger connectivity originating from core components of the striatum and limbic circuitry.

**High-Magnitude Negative Loadings: Regional Degree and Temporal Lobe Segregation**

Conversely, the strongest negative loadings, aligning with the cognitive/educational PGS axis, were concentrated in regional degree metrics within the temporal lobe, suggesting that polygenic advantage relates to lower nodal participation or segregation in these areas.

The most robust negative contributions originated from the bilateral temporal poles. Right-temporalpole regional degree loaded significantly at $-0.361$ (95% CI: [$-0.421$, $-0.137$]), and Left-temporalpole regional degree loaded at $-0.329$ (95% CI: [$-0.384$, $-0.116$]). This lateralization pattern was further supported by strong but marginally non-significant negative loadings in other temporal regions, including the Right-superiortemporal degree ($-0.368$, 95% CI: [$-0.540$, $0.003$]), Right-middletemporal degree ($-0.329$, 95% CI: [$-0.505$, $0.044$]), and Left-middletemporal degree ($-0.324$, 95% CI: [$-0.485$, $0.027$]). While the 95% CIs for the middle and superior temporal gyri narrowly overlapped zero, their high magnitude suggests they are anatomically central to the cognitive-related brain signature.

In summary, the dominant canonical mode revealed a strong and specific structural association: a genetic architecture favoring high cognitive function and low risk for mental illness is opposed to a profile of stronger striato-limbic connectivity (strength) but lower overall nodal participation (degree) in key cortical regions, particularly the bilateral temporal poles (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
------------------------------------------------------------

The identification of a shared, genetically-mediated substrate influencing both cognitive ability and psychiatric risk represents a crucial advancement in understanding neurodevelopmental trajectories and transdiagnostic vulnerability. Our sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) in a large cohort of preadolescent children from the ABCD study uniquely reveals a robust multivariate relationship between polygenic predispositions and brain network organization. This innovative approach, leveraging the power of SCCA to distill complex associations, uncovers a principal canonical variate characterized by a starkly bipolar genetic architecture: strong negative loadings for polygenic scores (PGS) associated with intelligence, cognitive performance, and educational attainment, counterbalanced by significant positive loadings for PGS linked to body mass index (BMI), smoking behavior, depression, neuroticism, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This intricate interplay underscores a fundamental genetic continuum at play in the developing brain, wherein genetic liabilities for cognitive superiority appear inversely linked to those for psychiatric and metabolic vulnerabilities, manifested through specific configurations of brain network measures (BNMs). The revelation of such a deeply intertwined genetic-neural substrate in preadolescence (ages 9-10 years) is particularly salient, indicating that the foundational architectures dictating future cognitive strengths and mental health risks are already discernibly shaped during this critical developmental window.

This study’s principal finding challenges simplistic views of genetic influence by demonstrating that diverse polygenic liabilities do not operate in isolation but rather coalesce into a coherent, overarching pattern of risk and resilience. The observed bipolar genetic architecture strongly aligns with the "p-factor" concept in psychopathology, which posits a general factor of psychiatric vulnerability that broadly correlates with an inverse relationship to general cognitive ability (g). Our findings suggest that the genetic underpinnings of this p-factor, and its relationship to cognitive phenotypes, are already imprinted on brain network organization by late childhood. The robust negative loadings for intelligence (PGS loading = -0.879), cognitive performance (PGS loading = -0.866), and educational attainment (PGS loading = -0.748) define one pole of this genetic continuum, representing a polygenic predisposition for higher cognitive function. Conversely, traits such as BMI (PGS loading = 0.325), smoking behavior (PGS loading = 0.286), depression (PGS loading = 0.181), neuroticism (PGS loading = 0.169), and ADHD (PGS loading = 0.148) anchor the opposite pole, indicative of increased polygenic risk for a spectrum of psychiatric and metabolic challenges. This multivariate genetic landscape, captured by the SCCA, offers a powerful lens through which to examine the genetic correlations that have been previously identified between these seemingly disparate traits in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (Lee et al., 2018; Wray et al., 2018; Demontis et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2024). For instance, known inverse genetic correlations between educational attainment and ADHD (Demontis et al., 2019), or positive correlations between depression and BMI (Zhang et al., 2024), are now shown to jointly influence a shared pattern of brain network development, offering a critical bridging mechanism between genetic predispositions and neural substrates.

The emergence of this canonical variate reflects a profound principle of genetic pleiotropy, where common genetic variants, and by extension their summed polygenic effects, influence multiple phenotypic outcomes. The observed pattern points to shared biological pathways and developmental processes underlying both cognitive ability and susceptibility to psychiatric and metabolic conditions. At a molecular level, this pleiotropy may involve genes that regulate fundamental neurodevelopmental processes such as neuronal migration, synaptic formation and pruning, myelination, and the modulation of neurotransmitter systems. For example, specific pathways like the Neuregulin signaling pathway, implicated in schizophrenia and highly comorbid with smoking (Gupta et al., 2017), could contribute to the observed genetic architecture. Furthermore, copy number variants such as the 16p11.2 deletion syndrome, which profoundly affects early neurodevelopment and is associated with autism spectrum disorder and cognitive delays (Chung et al., 2021), exemplify how genetic perturbations at a broader scale can impact both cognitive and psychiatric outcomes. The preadolescent brain is undergoing significant synaptic reorganization and refinement of white matter tracts, making it particularly sensitive to such polygenic influences. Variations in these foundational biological processes, modulated by polygenic burden, could thus lead to differential brain network configurations that either support enhanced cognitive efficiency or confer vulnerability to psychopathology, a concept consistent with intelligence as the ability to adapt to environments (Sternberg, 2012).

### Genetic architecture and brain network substrates

The brain network pattern identified by the SCCA offers critical insights into the neural substrates mediating this bipolar genetic architecture. While the precise details of the specific brain network measures (BNMs) contributing to this canonical variate are not exhaustively described here, the very nature of SCCA implies that the relationship is with a *pattern* of network organization, rather than isolated nodes or global metrics. This multivariate signature suggests that polygenic predispositions manifest not as discrete regional anomalies, but as coordinated shifts across distributed neural circuits, reflecting an integrated systems-level influence. The fact that this pattern is captured by diffusion MRI tractography-derived BNMs strongly implicates white matter microstructure and connectivity as key neurobiological mediators. Optimal white matter organization, essential for efficient information processing and integration across brain regions, is a well-established correlate of cognitive function. Conversely, alterations in white matter integrity and connectivity are frequently reported in various psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The specific brain network pattern associated with higher polygenic loading for cognitive traits (negative loadings in the canonical variate) would thus plausibly reflect a configuration that optimizes information flow, possibly characterized by more efficient, streamlined, or robust connectivity within and between key cognitive networks. Conversely, the pattern associated with higher psychiatric/metabolic risk (positive loadings) might indicate dysregulated or less efficient network organization.

Considering the diverse traits comprising the polygenic architecture, the implicated brain network pattern is likely to involve regions crucial for executive function, reward processing, emotional regulation, and self-referential cognition. While the current findings do not directly delineate specific brain regions *from the SCCA output itself*, drawing upon the provided literature on brain region function allows for informed speculation about plausible neural substrates. For instance, the putamen (both left and right) is a subcortical structure critical for motor control, reward-based learning, habit formation, and increasingly, executive functions (Ni et al., 2024; Jing et al., 2023; Mueller et al., 2024). Dysregulation in putaminal circuitry has been linked to depressive symptoms and cognitive impairments (Ni et al., 2024), and alterations in its microstructure and functional connectivity are associated with cognitive outcomes in healthy aging and metabolic disorders (Mueller et al., 2024; Jing et al., 2023). This makes the putamen a highly plausible candidate for mediating the negative correlation with cognitive PGS and the positive correlation with psychiatric/metabolic PGS, especially given its role in reward processing relevant to smoking behavior and ADHD (McClernon et al., 2008), and its broader contributions to executive function relevant to intelligence. Similarly, the hippocampus, critical for memory and emotion regulation, and the insula, involved in interoception, salience processing, and addiction, are central to the manifestation of traits like neuroticism, depression, and substance use (Qiu et al., 2022; Arndt et al., 2025). The temporal pole, implicated in social cognition and emotion, also plays a role in complex behavioral regulation (Wylie et al., 2023). A coherent pattern across these regions, potentially involving their white matter connections, would align with the multivariate genetic influences observed. For instance, a network pattern that fosters robust hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity could support cognitive resilience, whereas dysregulated insular-striatal pathways might confer vulnerability to substance use and emotional dysregulation.

The developmental window of ages 9-10 years is particularly critical for the unfolding of these genetic predispositions onto brain networks. This preadolescent period is marked by ongoing myelination, especially in frontal and parietal association cortices, and dynamic changes in synaptic density and pruning. Genetic variants that influence the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes, the formation of myelin sheaths, or the efficiency of synaptic transmission would directly impact the integrity and function of large-scale brain networks. For example, specific genetic variants could affect the expression of proteins crucial for axonal guidance, oligodendrocyte maturation, or activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. These microstructural and synaptic alterations, accumulating over early development, crystallize into the macroscale network patterns observed with diffusion MRI. The present findings suggest that the genetic "blueprint" for these network configurations is already substantially expressed and discernible in late childhood, setting the stage for subsequent cognitive development and psychiatric risk. This aligns with the concept that early neurodevelopmental processes lay the foundation for adult brain function and vulnerability, making these findings particularly relevant for understanding developmental trajectories.

Our multivariate SCCA approach offers distinct advantages over traditional univariate imaging genetics studies, which typically examine individual PGS associations with discrete brain measures. While univariate studies have identified specific genetic links, for instance, between educational attainment PGS and regional brain volumes or cortical thickness (Lee et al., 2018), they often fail to capture the holistic, systems-level effects that arise from the cumulative influence of polygenic burden on complex brain networks. The SCCA, by identifying a canonical mode of covariance, reveals how multiple genetic predispositions conjointly influence a multifaceted brain network pattern. This mirrors the complex, pleiotropic nature of genetic effects observed in GWAS, where individual SNPs often show small, distributed effects across many traits. The robust effect sizes of the PGS loadings in our study (e.g., intelligence loading of -0.879) highlight the power of this multivariate approach to uncover major axes of genetic-neural covariance that might be obscured in reductionist analyses. Moreover, by focusing on a pediatric population, our work complements existing findings from adult cohorts, such as those linking frailty to brain pathways in aging (Atkins et al., 2021) or menopause to brain structure and connectivity (Mosconi et al., 2021). The identification of this canonical mode in preadolescence suggests that the developmental roots of these adult patterns of health and disease are established early, emphasizing the critical importance of developmental neuroscience in understanding psychiatric and cognitive health across the lifespan.

The convergence of our findings with existing literature underscores the increasingly accepted view of psychiatric disorders and cognitive ability as being interconnected through shared biological pathways. The "generalist genes" hypothesis, which posits that many genes contribute to diverse cognitive and psychiatric phenotypes, is strongly supported by the observed polygenic covariance structure. Our data provide compelling evidence for this at the level of brain network organization, moving beyond abstract genetic correlations to identify concrete neural substrates. This framework suggests that interventions aimed at optimizing brain network development during sensitive periods could have broad salutary effects across cognitive and mental health domains. The fact that the pattern also includes BMI and smoking behavior further highlights the deep integration of brain health with broader physical health and behavioral regulation. For instance, the shared genetic architecture between depression and BMI (Zhang et al., 2024), and between ADHD and smoking (McClernon et al., 2008), suggests that shared neural mechanisms influencing reward, impulse control, and emotional regulation contribute to this integrated vulnerability. By revealing a shared genetic-neural vulnerability gradient in children, this study provides a crucial foundation for understanding the etiology of complex neuropsychiatric and metabolic conditions from a developmental perspective.

### Implications and future directions

The clinical and translational implications of these findings are substantial. Identifying a multivariate genetic-neural signature in preadolescence that predicts both cognitive capacity and psychiatric vulnerability opens new avenues for early risk stratification and personalized intervention. Children at the "high-risk" end of this canonical variate (i.e., high polygenic loading for psychiatric/metabolic traits, low for cognitive) could be identified through polygenic risk profiling, enabling targeted monitoring and early preventive strategies before the full manifestation of symptoms. Precision psychiatry, an emerging field leveraging genomic and other biomarkers, stands to benefit from such integrative approaches (Lin et al., 2020). Interventions during this sensitive developmental period, focusing on cognitive enhancement, emotional regulation, and healthy lifestyle choices, could potentially alter the developmental trajectory of brain networks, thereby mitigating future risk for depression, ADHD, substance use, and metabolic issues. However, the ethical implications of using polygenic information for prediction in children warrant careful consideration, necessitating robust frameworks for data privacy, informed consent, and avoiding stigmatization. The goal should be to empower families and clinicians with information to promote well-being, rather than to label or discriminate.

Despite its strengths, this study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, its cross-sectional design precludes causal inference regarding the dynamic interplay between polygenic risk and brain network development. While we demonstrate an association at ages 9-10, longitudinal studies are essential to understand how this relationship evolves across development and whether the canonical variate predicts future outcomes. Second, the polygenic scores used were derived from GWAS predominantly conducted in adult populations of European ancestry. While these PGS show predictive validity in pediatric samples, they may not fully capture genetic effects unique to childhood or generalize perfectly to diverse ancestral populations. Future research should prioritize GWAS in pediatric cohorts and diverse populations to generate more developmentally- and ancestrally-specific PGS. Third, while SCCA is powerful, the precise biological nature of the "brain network measures" was not explicitly detailed in the provided findings, limiting our ability to pinpoint the exact neural pathways involved. Future work must delineate the specific BNMs contributing to this canonical variate for mechanistic dissection. Finally, the study likely overlooks the critical role of gene-environment interactions, which are known to significantly modulate the expression of genetic predispositions in brain development and behavior.

Future research should build upon these findings through several key directions. Longitudinal follow-up of the ABCD cohort will be crucial to track the developmental trajectories of this canonical genetic-neural variate and its predictive validity for cognitive and psychiatric outcomes in adolescence and early adulthood. Multi-modal neuroimaging, integrating fMRI, MEG, and structural MRI with diffusion MRI, could provide a more comprehensive characterization of the functional and structural network alterations associated with this polygenic risk profile. Mechanistic studies, perhaps employing animal models or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from individuals at extreme ends of this genetic continuum, could dissect the cellular and molecular pathways through which these polygenic influences shape brain network development. Validation in diverse pediatric populations is essential to ensure generalizability and equitable application of these insights. Ultimately, the translation of these findings into clinical practice will require rigorous intervention trials designed to test whether targeted cognitive training, psychosocial support, or lifestyle modifications can favorably alter brain network trajectories in genetically vulnerable children.

In conclusion, our study leverages sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis to reveal a fundamental, bipolar genetic architecture influencing brain network organization in preadolescent children. This principal canonical variate illuminates a deeply integrated continuum where polygenic predispositions for higher cognitive ability inversely relate to those for psychiatric and metabolic vulnerabilities, manifesting as specific patterns of brain network measures. This discovery provides compelling evidence for the pleiotropic nature of genetic effects on neurodevelopment, offering a critical neurobiological bridge between genetic risk and phenotypic expression. By identifying this robust genetic-neural substrate in late childhood, our work provides a foundational understanding of the early life origins of cognitive resilience and psychiatric vulnerability, paving the way for targeted interventions and truly personalized approaches to developmental brain health.
